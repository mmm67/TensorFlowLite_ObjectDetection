# Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite, CameraX, and Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates how to use **CameraX**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and **Jetpack Compose** to build an object detection app for Android. The app utilizes the **EfficientDet-Lite** model to perform real-time object detection on the camera feed.

## Features

- **Real-time object detection** using TensorFlow Lite and EfficientDet-Lite model.
- **CameraX integration** to capture the camera feed.
- **Jetpack Compose UI** to display detected objects and bounding boxes on the screen.
- Efficient model inference for on-device processing with TensorFlow Lite.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow Lite**: For efficient and fast on-device machine learning inference.
- **CameraX**: To provide a camera feed for real-time object detection.
- **Jetpack Compose**: To build a modern UI with Kotlinâ€™s declarative UI framework
